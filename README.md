# VivariumMonitor

As an avid keeper of reptiles and also a software developer, I wasn't happy with
the options available on the market for smart-thermostats. I wanted an open
solution that could support both analog and digital outputs, was simple to
connect a variety of controllable devices to, and supported readings from
multiple sensors. It also needed the ability to define functions for
controlling the output devices, and above all, it needed to be robust. 

This repository contains the library code for the vivarium monitors I designed.
The PCB schematics and firmware for the output controller will be released in a
separate repository once I have it cleaned up a bit.
